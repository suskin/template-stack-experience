# The behaviors configuration specifies how the shared
# controller should respond to various events.
#
# Currently the behaviors configuration only specifies
# what templates should be rendered in response to an
# instance of a known CRD, but it could be used to specify
# other behaviors, such as:
# * Rendering templates at install time
# * Updating the status field of an instance of a known CRD
